stanza.io
=========

Stanza.io allows you to build realtime web applications using the
socket.io you already know and love, while also integrating with
XMPP to gain federated presence, identity, pubsub, and more.

No more worries about dealing with BOSH or the current issues
with websockets. And no need to parse or build any XML when
using the common subset of supported XMPP extensions. 


Getting Started
---------------

Install and run the demo server:

    git clone https://github.com/legastero/stanza.io
    npm install
    node server

View demo:

* Go to http://localhost:3000
* View source and play with the JS console, for now.
